# Communication and feedback document templates

Since going freelance, and working almost exclusively on remote projects, I’ve had to write documents like this for ~50% of my projects. While a lot of clients ‘get’ things like Slack and InVision, a lot still don’t.

I’ve found that most clients will get on board with ‘however you work best’, which is great. These docs are a super simple starting point for laying our the shit you like to do so you can do your best work. The basic idea is that asynchronous communication is best 99% of the time, allowing you to do the shit you’re good at without constant interruptions/an over-abundance of Skype calls, face-to-face meetings, conference calls, etc. etc.

Feel free to use them as-is, edit them for your own purposes, or tell me how pointless I am.
